## Aman's approach

1. Created a function **`isPrime(num)`** for checking if any number is prime or not, it returns boolean values i.e. true if number is prime and false if number is not prime.
2. Created another function **`findNthPrime(n)`** for finding nth prime number.
3. In **`findNthPrime(n)`** fuction we maintain a variable **`count`** for counting number of primes.
4. We are calling **`isPrime(num)`** for each number starting from 2 and incrementing **`count`** if number is prime.
5. When **`count`** is equal to **`n`** then we return the number.
